# The Amazing Trace

**A QR code-based scavenger hunt for informal learning written in Go**

## About The Project

The Amazing Trace was developed for the University of Otago as an orientation week event alternative to tours for large groups. The goal of the game was to familiarise students with campus and support services quickly. Each team receives a of three randomly chosen locations, with one randomly chosen clue for each location. They must solve the clue, navigate to the correct location, then scan the poster or enter the URL to verify their answer. Play continues until the allotted time runs out.

I created this game as part of a Master of Science Communition project investigating resource-efficient games for spatially-located learning.

## Game play

Participants are given a team code, which are randomly generated when the game is launched. The team code is written on a card and given out. The card contains the minimum set of instructions to enable players to engage.

The server asks for the team code which it then stores and remembers.

These posters are placed around the area of play.

The game runs to a schedule, meaning all players can start and end at the same time. The game tells players how much time is left, and then instructs players to return to base before time runs out.
